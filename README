The GNU Hurd
============

This is not the GNU Hurd.  But it might become it at some day.

The intention is to port the GNU Hurd to run on the L4 microkernel.

This is work in progress.


How to build
------------

It is not yet straightforward.  Something like the below should work:

$ autoreconf -f -i -s
$ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --prefix=/l4
$ cd libl4
$ make; make install
$ cd ..
$ make CFLAGS=-I/l4/include\ -g\ -O3
$ mkdir /l4/boot
$ cp laden/laden /l4/boot
$ cp wortel/wortel /l4/boot

You also need the L4 kernel and sigma0.  sigma0 must be built with a
different link base than the default value 0x20000, because that
conflicts with GRUB (on ia32).  I have successfully used a link base
of 0x40000.  Then set up GRUB to boot laden as the kernel, and the L4
kernel, sigma0 and wortel (the rootserver) as its modules.
