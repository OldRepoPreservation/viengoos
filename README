The GNU Hurd
============

This is not the GNU Hurd.  But it might become it at some day.

The intention is to port the GNU Hurd to run on the L4 microkernel.

This is work in progress.


How to build
------------

It is not yet straightforward.  Something like the below should work:

$ autoreconf -f -i -s
$ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --prefix=/l4
$ cd libl4
$ make; make install
$ cd ..
$ make CFLAGS=-I/l4/include
$ mkdir /l4/boot
$ cp laden /l4/boot

You also need the L4 kernel, sigma0 and a rootserver.  Then set up
GRUB to boot laden as the kernel, and the L4 kernel, sigma0 and the
rootserver as its modules.
