* configure.ac
** Allow user to specify libc.a.

* laden
** Overlaps between modules and destination regions should be resolved
   intelligently.
** Support for sigma1 needs to be added when sigma1 exists.
** Shutdown should sleep a couple of seconds before reboot.
** When L4 supports it, the UTCB area of the rootserver should be set
   in the KIP.
** Conventional memory overriding non-conventional memory in the
   descriptor list is not supported.
** Add loaded modules as bootloader specific types to memory
   descriptor list (for sigma0 and wortel).


* wortel
** Link base should be configurable.
** Conventional memory overriding non-conventional memory in the
   descriptor list is not supported.


* physmem
** Link base should be configurable.


* libhurd-slab
** Ideally this would be a feature in glibc.


* libhurd-ihash
** Can be merged back into the Hurd if the callers are changed.
** Need to decide on the hurd_ihash_key_t type: unsigned int vs. uint32_t.
   The latter seems to be sufficient.  Might even be uint64_t, though.
   Johan Rydberg suggested uintptr_t.
