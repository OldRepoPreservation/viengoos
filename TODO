* libl4
  The TODO list for libl4 is in the file libl4/TODO.

* configure.ac
** Allow user to specify location of libc.a.


* laden
** Implement the Generic Booting Protocol (Appendix J
   l4-x2-20040823.pdf and newer).
** Overlaps between modules and destination regions should be resolved
   intelligently.
** Support for sigma1 needs to be added when sigma1 exists.
** Shutdown should sleep a couple of seconds before reboot.  How can
   this be done without any operating system (maybe use the BIOS?).
** When L4 supports it, the UTCB area of the rootserver should be set
   in the KIP.
** Memory descriptors need to be constructed and handled carefully,
   verify that everything is all-right.  In particular: conventional
   memory overriding non-conventional memory in the descriptor list is
   not supported, but should be.
** Add loaded modules as bootloader specific types to memory
   descriptor list (for sigma0 and wortel).  But check with the
   Generic Booting Protocol specification first!
** Fix the memory descriptors: Consistently set the high value right.
   Mark all bootloader stuff as bootloader specific, to prevent that
   L4 scribbles over it accidently.  This includes the GRUB info as
   well as all modules beyond the rootserver module.


* wortel
** Use the Generic Booting Protocol (Appendix J l4-x2-20040823.pdf and
   newer).  Needs corresponding support in laden.
** Conventional memory overriding non-conventional memory in the
   descriptor list is not supported, but should be.


* libhurd-slab
** Ideally this would be a feature in glibc.
** Should support alignment requirements properly.
** Should check return value from constructor.
** Implement hurd_slab_destroy ().


* libhurd-ihash
** Can be merged back into the Hurd if the callers are changed.


* L4 (for lack of a better place)
** Check that L4 does not schedule the client when the server makes a
   non-blocking reply.
** Check that L4 does schedule the server when the client makes a
   blocking call.
