* configure.ac
** Allow user to specify location of libc.a.


* laden
** Overlaps between modules and destination regions should be resolved
   intelligently.
** Support for sigma1 needs to be added when sigma1 exists.
** Shutdown should sleep a couple of seconds before reboot.
** When L4 supports it, the UTCB area of the rootserver should be set
   in the KIP.
** Conventional memory overriding non-conventional memory in the
   descriptor list is not supported.
** Add loaded modules as bootloader specific types to memory
   descriptor list (for sigma0 and wortel).
** Fix the memory descriptors: Consistently set the high value right.
   Mark all bootloader stuff has bootloader specific, to prevent that
   L4 scribbles over it accidently.  This includes the GRUB info as
   well as all modules beyond the rootserver module.

* wortel
** Conventional memory overriding non-conventional memory in the
   descriptor list is not supported.


* libhurd-slab
** Ideally this would be a feature in glibc.
** Should support alignment requirements properly.
** Should check return value from constructor.
** Implement hurd_slab_destroy ().


* libhurd-ihash
** Can be merged back into the Hurd if the callers are changed.
** Need to decide on the hurd_ihash_key_t type: unsigned int vs. uint32_t.
   The latter seems to be sufficient.  Might even be uint64_t, though.
   Johan Rydberg suggested uintptr_t.

* L4 (for lack of a better place)
** Check that L4 does not schedule the client when the server makes a
   non-blocking reply.
** Check that L4 does schedule the server when the client makes a
   blocking call.
