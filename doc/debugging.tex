\chapter{Debugging}
\label{debug}

L4 does not support debugging.  So every task has to implement a debug
interface and implement debugging locally.  gdb needs to be changed to
make use of this interface.  How to perform the required
authentication, and how the debug thread is advertised to gdb, and how
the debug interface should look like, are all open questions.
