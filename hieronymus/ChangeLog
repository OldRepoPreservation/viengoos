2008-06-29  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* hieronymus.c: Include <md5.h>.

	(stats_count): New variable.
	(stats): Likewise.
	(do_gather_stats): New function.
	(main): If --stats is specified, fork a thread to gather

	line removing the requirement that a module have a command line
	variable.

	* Makefile.am (modules.h): When generating variable names, replace
	any -'s with _'s.
	($(addsuffix .S, $(files))): Likewise.

2008-02-21  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Remove variable.

	(hieronymus_CPPFLAGS): New variable.
	(hieronymus_CFLAGS): Likewise.

	be consistent with new API.

2008-02-13  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* hieronymus.c (main): Don't pass ACTIVITY_POLICY_VOID to
	activity_alloc.  Build up a policy based on the configuration and
	pass that instead.

	call to rm_activity_policy.
	
2008-02-13  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am ($(addsuffix .S, $(files))): Add a dependency on the

	location of the binary.
	($(addsuffix .o, $(files))): Don't include search paths.
