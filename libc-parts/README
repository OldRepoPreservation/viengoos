libc-parts
==========

libc-parts is a convenience library that is built by taking functions
from the statically linked GNU C library of the host system.

Even if you can not link to the whole of the C library, you can often
link to specific functions to it, which don't have a lot of
dependencies.  This includes memory and string operations, as well as
many other low level operations (byte swap routines, bit search
functions, etc).

These functions are usually cleverly optimized for the host processor,
and well tested.  So taking the standard implementations gives best
over-all performance, avoids code duplications, and is the least error
prone solution.

There is obviously a boot strap issue in this approach.  However, this
is not a serious problem as the functions are not OS dependent, and
thus any static GNU C library for the host CPU will do.
