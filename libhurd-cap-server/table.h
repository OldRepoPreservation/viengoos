/* The hurd_table data type is a fancy array.  At initialization time,
   you have to provide the size ENTRY_SIZE of each table entry.  When
   you enter an element, you get an index number in return.  This
   index can be used for fast lookup of table elements.  You access
   the table elements through pointers to the beginning of the each
   block of ENTRY_SIZE bytes.

   Embedded at the beginning of the ENTRY_SIZE bytes in each slot is a
   void pointer.  You can use this void pointer freely for your own
   purpose with the following restriction: In a used table entry, it
   must never be NULL.  NULL at the beginning of a table entry
   indicates an unused (free) table entry.

   The table will grow (and eventually shrink, not yet implemented)
   automatically.  New elements are always allocated from the
   beginning of the table.  This means that when a new element is
   added, the free slot with the lowest index is always used.  This
   makes slot usage predictable and attempts to prevent fragmentation
   and sparse usage.

   Note that tables, unlike hashes, can not be reorganized, because
   the index is not stable under reorganization.

   Of all operations supported, only lookup is immediate.  Entering
   new elements is usually fast, too, unless the first free slot is
   unknown and has to be searched for, or there are no more free slots
   and the table has to be enlarged.

   Iterating over the used elements of the table is always
   of the order of the table size.

   In the future, removing an element can also shrink the table.  In
   order to be able to do this, the implementation keeps track of the
   last used slot.  For this reason, the remove operation is sometimes
   not immediate.  */
