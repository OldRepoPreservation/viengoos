	* ihash.h (hurd_ihash_locp_remove): Fix comment.
	* t-ihash.c (program_name): Add variable.
	(main): Add a test case for hurd_ihash_locp_remove.

2007-10-16  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* ihash.h: Don't include <sys/types.h>.
	Include <stddef.h> and <stdbool.h>.

2007-10-09  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* ihash.h (hurd_ihash_locp_remove): Update comment.

2007-10-06  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* ihash.h (hurd_ihash_replace): New prototype.
	(hurd_ihash_add): Replace prototype with a static inline
	implementation that calls hurd_ihash_replace with the right
	parameters.
	* ihash.c (locp_remove): Take additional argument, cleanup.  Only
	call the cleanup function if CLEANUP is true.  Update callers.
	(add_one): Rename from this...
	(replace_one): ... to this.  Add two parameters, had_value and
	old_value.  If the key has a value and OLD_VALUE is not NULL, then
	do not call the cleanup function but save the old value in
	*OLD_VALUE.  If the key had a value and HAD_VALUE is not NULL,
	then store true in *HAD_VALUE, otherwise, false.  Update callers.
	
	* Makefile.am (TESTS): Set to t-ihash.
	(check_PROGRAMS): Set to t-ihash.
	(t_ihash_SOURCES): Set to t-ihash.c and ihash.h.

	* ihash.h (hurd_ihash_replace): New declaration.
	(hurd_ihash_add): Replace declaration with a static inline stub
	that calls hurd_ihash_replace.
	* ihash.c (add_one): Rename from this...
	(replace_one): ... to this.  Add two parameters.  Save the old key
	value in *OLD_VALUE.  Save whether there was an old value in
	*HAD_VALUE.  Update callers.
	(hurd_ihash_add): Rename from this...
	(hurd_ihash_replace): ... to this.  Add two parameters.  Pass them
	in calls to replace_one.

	(add_one): Don't take a locp argument anymore.  Use quadratic
	probing.  Call locp_remove instead duplicating the code.
	Increment HT->nr_items.
	(hurd_ihash_add): Don't take a locp argument anymore.  Check
	maximum load factor before adding element.  Use ITEMS and not KEYS
	and TABLE.  Don't allocate memory for locp.  Use calloc instead of
