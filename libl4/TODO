* Bugs
** Fix _L4_msg_get_string_item.

* Optimizations:
** l4_time_period for built-in constants.
** l4_exchange_register does not need to copy out return values if the
   "deliver" bit is not set, this can usually be tested at compilation
   time.  Check if this is a useful optimization or if gcc already
   optimizes that away automatically.

* Implement:
** l4_time_point.
** Support for all those architectures.

* Extend:
** We need cancellable IPC.  This is a bummer.
** Add l4_time_t period shift operators for fast exponential backoff
   (ie, just increase the exponent).  Use in __pthread_spin_lock, for
   example.
** Sanitize the error handling.  The GNU interface should return
   proper errno values for all failures.  ExchangeRegister can fail,
   so all functions using it should also return an error value
   (l4_start_sp_ip etc) (currently result is undefined).  Handle IPC
   errors somehow intelligently.

* GNU interface
** Implement the cache hint support functions.
** Implement l4_thread_was_* functions.

* Compatibility interface
** Implement more of the inofficial extensions to the official libl4
   library (things like sigma0.h).
** Think about syscall stubs, which are initialized lazily in the
   official libl4, while we require manual initialization (good enough
   for use with our linker, but what about compatibility?).
