2008-01-17  Neal H. Walfield  <neal@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: (patches): Remove variable.  Update users to use
	$(patch_files) directly.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Prefix the addon fields with `addon/'.
	($(srcdir)/newlib): Make it depend on the tarball.  When
	extracted, touch it.
	($(srcdir)/newlib-patch-stamp): Remove rule.
	($(addsuffix -applied,$(patch_files))): Replace with rule to copy
	the applied patch to the build directory and use that as a
	reference.  If the source patch is changed, revert the original
	patch before applying the new patch.
	($(addprefix $(srcdir)/newlib/, $(addon))): Depend on the
	individual addon files rather than a stamp file.  When linking
	add-on files into the source tree, pass -f to ln.
	(newlib-configure-stamp): When configuring, add
	--enable-maintainer-mode.
	(clean-local): Remove the source directory.
	(CLEANFILES): Remove $(srcdir)/newlib-stamp.
