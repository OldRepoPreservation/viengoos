The root server ruth
--------------------

Ruth is a root server, but it is not _the_ root server.  It is only intended for
testing and playing with the system.  Feel free to hack it to your liking.

The real root server will actually be a bootstrapping filesystem server, like
ext2fs.

Until that is available, this cheesy stub is all you get.
