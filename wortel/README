wortel
======

wortel is the rootserver of the Hurd on L4.  It is responsible for
booting up the system and wrapping privileged L4 operations.

For now, only a rudimentary part of the loader is written, and the
only useful thing wortel can do is to start the dummy physmem server
for a small demonstration.
