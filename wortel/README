wortel
======

wortel is the rootserver of the Hurd on L4.  It is responsible for
booting up the system and wrapping privileged L4 operations.

For now, only a rudimentary part of the loader is written, and the
only useful thing wortel can do is to start the dummy physmem server
for a small demonstration.


OUTPUT
======

The available output drivers are architecture specific (see below for
details).  You can suppress all output by using the output driver
"none", which is available on all architectures.

Some drivers support options.  You list the options you want to use
directly following the driver name, separated by commas.  For example,
to specify COM2 and a baud rate of 9600, you would use the option "-o
serial,uart2,speed=9600".  Note that spaces are not allowed (as spaces
separate the arguments to wortel).  Which options are recognized
depends on the driver.

Serial output
-------------

The serial output driver supports options to configure the serial
port.  The following options are recognized:

uart1       Select UART1 (aka COM1).
uart2       Select UART2 (aka COM2).
speed=BAUD  Set the baud rate to BAUD.  Possible values are 50 to 115200.


Architecture Specific Notes
===========================

ia32
----

On this architecture, wortel supports VGA and serial output.
